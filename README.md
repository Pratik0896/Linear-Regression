## Liner regression model to estimate CO2 emmision.
- Implemented Linear Regression model to predict the CO2 emmision for new light-duty vehicles based on its engine size.
- Used scikit learn library to build regression model.
- Predicted the accuracy using r2-score and MSE loss functions.
- Visualized the results.
